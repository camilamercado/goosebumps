<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I found it
yesterday in a cave,&quot; she explains. &quot;It's a doll of an old Native
American wind spirit. I was on a tour with my school. The tour guide told us the
old legend. He said the tribe believed that the spirit of the wind is kept in
the cave by the doll. But if the doll is removed from its place in the cave, the
spirit sends a twister to get it back.&quot; She sighs. &quot;I know it was
stupid, but I couldn't help myself. The doll was so pretty, I felt like I just
had to take it.&quot;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">You take a deep
breath. This story is incredible.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I'm still
not sure I believe you,&quot; you tell Wendy. &quot;But if you're telling the
truth, why don't you just throw the doll away?&quot;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Because
then the wind spirit will be even angrier,&quot; Wendy explains. &quot;And the
twister will never stop. But if I can get the doll back to its place in the
cave, the tornado will disappear. And the damage it's caused will be
undone.&quot;</font></p>
