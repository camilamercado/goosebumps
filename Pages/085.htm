you scream. The wind spins you around in the air, first slowly, then faster and
faster. Soon you're lifted out of the cave and into the air above the mountain.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">You stop
spinning as the wind floats you over the countryside. You gaze down. Whoa!

your own farm. You watch as everything returns to the way it was before the
twister hit.</font></p>

uncle probably don't remember anything about the twister, you realize. Better
not to remind them.</font></p>

hanging out with some friends,&quot; you answer. &quot;And we were, uh - totally
into this game called Twister!&quot;</font></p>
