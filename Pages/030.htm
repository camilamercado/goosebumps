<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">You stop
yourself at the last moment. These animals sound as if they hate humans. They're
not going to be too happy that you overheard their secrets. But Yoyo must have
known they were in here. Why did he lead you to this house?</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">And, hey, what happened to Yoyo,
anyway?</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">Quietly you step
outside the farmhouse. The storm has passed and the sky is beginning to clear.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">There is your
dog, Yoyo, sitting by the doorway. You're no longer freaked out when he talks to
you. But you are amazed. You stand there with your mouth hanging open.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now you know,&quot; he
says in a low voice.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;Yes.&quot;
You nod. &quot;I know. Why didn't you ever talk to me before?&quot;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;We can't
talk all the time,&quot; he explains as he licks his paws. &quot;But something
happens to us when a big storm is coming or when an earthquake is about to hit.
We gain special powers. And we can talk.&quot;</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">You shake your head. This is so
totally weird.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;I'm glad you told
me,&quot; you say, kneeling down.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" style="text-indent: 25"><font face="Verdana">&quot;There's
something else I wanted to tell you,&quot; the dog continues. &quot;Your aunt
and uncle are in trouble!&quot;</font></p>
