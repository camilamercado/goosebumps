<div class="story">"I can't!"you shout back. "Not without Yoyo!"<br>
Yoyo - your trusty little black dog.<br> 
Where is he? He usually follows you everywhere.<br> 
You turn to go find him, but dust clogs the air. 
You can barely see! The wind tugs at your clothes. It's hard even to stay on your feet.<br> 
Uncle Jed's strong hand lands on your shoulder.<br> 
"Come on, now," he cries in your ear. "There's no time!"<br> 
But over the fierce howling of the wind, you think you hear a faint noise. Is it...?<br> 
It is!<br> 
It's Yoyo's bark!
